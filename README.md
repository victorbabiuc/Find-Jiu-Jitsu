## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Known Issues & Solutions

#### Share Modal Not Appearing

**Issue**: Modal not appearing when share button is tapped in `OpenMatCard` component.

**Symptoms**: 
- Share button responds to tap but no modal appears
- Console logs show `handleShareOptions` is called but modal remains hidden
- No error messages in console

**Root Cause**: Modal was being rendered inside a `TouchableOpacity` wrapper, which can cause rendering issues in React Native.

**Solution**: 
1. Move the Modal component outside the main `TouchableOpacity` wrapper
2. Ensure Modal is rendered at the root level of the component
3. Add debugging console logs to track state changes

**Files Involved**:
- `src/components/OpenMatCard.tsx` - Main component with share functionality
- `src/components/ShareCard.tsx` - Component for screenshot capture
- `src/utils/screenshot.ts` - Screenshot utility functions

**Debug Steps**:
1. Add console logs in `handleShareOptions` function
2. Track `showShareOptions` state changes with `useEffect`
3. Verify Modal is outside TouchableOpacity wrapper
4. Check for any parent component interference

**Code Pattern**:
```tsx
// ‚ùå Wrong - Modal inside TouchableOpacity
<TouchableOpacity>
  <Modal visible={showShareOptions}>
    {/* Modal content */}
  </Modal>
</TouchableOpacity>

// ‚úÖ Correct - Modal outside TouchableOpacity
<TouchableOpacity>
  {/* Card content */}
</TouchableOpacity>
<Modal visible={showShareOptions}>
  {/* Modal content */}
</Modal>
```
