[‚Üê Back to README](../README.md)

## Current Status (v1.3.0)

### ‚úÖ **LIVE ON APP STORE**
These features are currently available to users:

- **Core gym browsing** - Browse open mat sessions by city
- **Smart filtering** - Filter by Gi, No-Gi, or Free sessions
- **Date selection** - Choose specific dates or use quick filters
- **Favorites system** - Save preferred gyms locally
- **Enhanced sharing** - Share sessions with professional image cards

- **Gym information** - Complete session details, pricing, contact info
- **One-tap actions** - Call gyms, get directions, visit websites
- **Responsive design** - Works on all iOS device sizes
- **Advanced search** - Real-time gym search with dropdown results

### ‚úÖ **RECENTLY COMPLETED (v2.0 Architecture)**
Major refactoring and code quality improvements:

- **Component Architecture Refactoring** - Extracted 1,927 lines into focused sub-components
- **Custom Hooks Implementation** - 4 reusable hooks for consistent state management
- **Utility Functions Consolidation** - Centralized gym utilities and professional logging
- **TypeScript Safety Improvements** - Enhanced type safety across all components
- **Performance Optimizations** - Reduced re-renders and improved bundle size
- **Professional Logging System** - Replaced 100+ console.log statements

### üîÑ **IN DEVELOPMENT**
These features are partially implemented but not yet functional:

- **Map view** - Visual gym locations (currently has compilation errors)
- **Authentication system** - Google/Apple Sign-In (UI implemented, backend not connected)
- **User profiles** - Profile screens exist but not functional

## Known Issues

### üöß Map View (In Development)
- **Status**: Compilation errors preventing map functionality
- **Issue**: react-native-maps plugin configuration and syntax errors
- **Impact**: Map toggle shows location list instead of actual map
- **Workaround**: Use list view for gym browsing
- **Priority**: Medium

### üîê Authentication (In Development)
- **Status**: UI implemented but backend not connected
- **Issue**: Firebase integration not completed
- **Impact**: Sign-in buttons present but not functional
- **Workaround**: App works without authentication
- **Priority**: Low

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Require Cycle Warning
- **Status**: Console warning, no functional impact
- **Issue**: Circular import dependency in navigation
- **Fix**: Import directly from specific files instead of index
- **Priority**: Low

### üîç Search UX Issues (Deferred)
- **Status**: Core search functionality works correctly (unique gyms, no duplicates), but minor UX issues remain
- **Issues**:
  - Double X-click required: Modal close ‚Üí then search X button (should be single action)
  - ShareCard over-rendering: `(() => {})()` pattern causes excessive renders during search
  - Click outside doesn't close: `pointerEvents="box-none"` disables backdrop when results visible
  - Copy button triggers re-renders affecting modal state
- **Root Cause**: Complex state management between search results, modal visibility, and ShareCard rendering in DashboardScreen.tsx (lines 783, 1038-1045)
- **Solution Path**: Fix backdrop pointer events logic + optimize ShareCard with useMemo. Avoid restructuring modal hierarchy (high complexity)
- **Impact**: Low - UX polish issue, not breaking functionality
- **Priority**: Low
